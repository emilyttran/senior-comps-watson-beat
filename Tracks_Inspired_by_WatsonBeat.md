# Tracks Inspired by Watson Beat

As a composer who also helped create and develop Watson Beat, I would like to share some of my tracks that were inspired by Watson Beat. These were all collaborations with earlier prototype versions of Watson Beat. Some of them were me using musical fragments created by Watson Beat as recurring motives. Others consist of Watson Beat doing most of the heavy lifting and composing while I tweaked and placed some final touches. Enjoy!
